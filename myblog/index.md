# MEDIA FRAMING : THE BIAS IN INTERNATIONAL NEWS COVERAGE #

With the development of new technologies, people have access to tremendous amounts of sources to keep up with the events of the world. This increase of sources made it nearly impossible for people to get a sense of how biased the media are in transferring the facts and events. With an increasing number of sources, there is increasing risks of misinformation. The goal of our project is to raise awareness of the potential bias of news sources in each country and develop a visual representation to demonstrate it. To that aim, we used the dataset provided by the GDELT project which contains the key information needed to investigate international news coverage. The idea is to offer textual analysis and graphical content to present the results. We will include node graphs linking sources to one another and maps that will indicate the different characteristics of media coverage in different countries.
